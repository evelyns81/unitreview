    <h1>Lesson 1# Variables Explore</h1>
    <p>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?
</p>
      <hr>
    <p>Answer:A strategy of mine is to make connections with things that i find intersting and easy to remember.Like Sofia she likes to make connections .</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave1" id="q2">
    <h1>Lesson 2# Variables Investigate</h1>
      <p>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?
</p>
      <hr>
    <p>Answer:we only send 2 options instead of more options because most of the questions that are asked only have a yes or no answer and there would be no need of added more.</p>
      </div> 
    <div class="wave1" id="q3">
    <h1>Lesson 3# Variables Practice</h1>
    <p>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?
</p>
      <hr>
    <p>Answer:The number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave1" id="q4">
    <h1>Lesson 4# Variables Make</h1>
    <p>How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?
</p>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="wave1" id="q5">
    <h1>Lesson 5# Conditionals Explore</h1>
    <p>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</p>
      <hr>
    <p><p>Answer:no, because it would be harder and not easy to add with others. And they would be negative so it wouldnt work.</p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave1" id="q7">
    <h1>Lesson 7# C.F.U</h1>
    <p>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?
</p>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="wave1" id="q8">
    <h1>Lesson 8# C.F.U</h1>
    <p>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.
</p>
      <hr>
    <p>Answer:The process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave1" id="q9">
    <h1>Lesson 9# C.F.U</h1>
    <p>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</p>
      <hr>
    <p>I would tell them that their book is still there and the reason of why the bits are smaller is because it was to much information that the computer made it into smaller parts to save  data but it did not lose any information.</p>

    <h1>Lesson 10# C.F.U</h1>
    <p>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?
