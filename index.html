    <b>Unit 1</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In Unit 1 I started learning about computer science and watched videos as well as how to send information from one device to another. We also learned binary numbers where we used our flippy do we used it for between binary and decimal as well as learning how to use place values.  We also learned about replacing numbers with bits and with those bits we were able to make colors like black and white and others. And HTML like start and end tags.

  <div class="wave" id="u2">
    <b>Unit 2</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In unit 2 we learned about the internet and how to use the network and being able to send in different places. As well as knowing how to send stuff using different routes and how to send more than one and send them as a packet . And when sending a packet you need an address to be able to send it. It was about digital information and how they are used. They are more than just letters and numbers, there are bits and many more things that go into sending and receiving.
 </p>

  <div class="wave" id="u3">
    <b>Unit 3</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In unit 3 we were able to learn about apps and how to make one and being able to design it. We learned how to add screen buttons, images and text to make an app. When making the apps we also needed to be able to program them and build functions of the app. The programming makes the app able to run and work for others to use it. In coding there are alot bugs so we have to learn to debug so they app is able to work perfectly.
 </p>
  </div>
  <div class="wave" id="u4">
    <b>Unit 4</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In unit 4 we learned about variables, conditional, and functions. Variables are used to put in the information that needs to be used. There can be different variables like numbers, words or lists.For conditional we used the statement "if-else" or "if-else-if" which are used for different outputs.there were also strings and expressions. And how expressions turn into new values. As well as how to be able to use code differently like instead of rewriting s code we can use the repeat loop or literate. We also use true or false statements,&&. Boolean expressions,conditional statements and logical operators.
