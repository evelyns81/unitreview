    <h1>Lesson 2# C.F.U</h1>
      <p>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?
</p>

    <h1>Lesson 9# C.F.U</h1>
    <p>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</p>
      <hr>
    <p>Answer:I would tell them that their book is still there and the reason of why the bits are smaller is because it was to much information that the computer made it into smaller parts to save  data but it did not lose any information.</p>
